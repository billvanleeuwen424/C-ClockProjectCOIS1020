# C-ClockProjectCOIS1020
In our first programming course at TrentU Computer Science, we learn the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming. This project is one desiged to showcase the student's understanding of classes, objects, methods, arrays, and all other skills learned earlier in the course.

The task is to create a program in which clock objects can be created, modified, and compared. This involved overloading operators, overloading built in methods, and creating logic to add clock objects together. 

This project, while basic in scope, is a demonstration of the of the foundational skills required for the rest of our programming careers.
